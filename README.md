# xenon
The Intrig message decoder.

Building the source:

    make && make test

After building, a static library, xenon, can be found in the o directory.

See the examples directory for some common uses of the decoder.

Also, the tools directory contains examples, such as idm and xv.

For your application, you just need the contents of the include directory and link with the xenon library.
