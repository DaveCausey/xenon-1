5.8 MBMS 

5.8.1           Introduction 

5.8.1.1             General 

In general the control information relevant only for UEs supporting MBMS is separated as much as possible from 
unicast control information. Most of the MBMS control information is provided on a logical channel specific for 
MBMS common control information: the MCCH. E-UTRA employs one MCCH logical channel per MBSFN area. In 
case the network configures multiple MBSFN areas, the UE acquires the MBMS control information from the MCCHs 
that are configured to identify if services it is interested to receive are ongoing. The action applicable when the UE is 
unable to simultaneously receive MBMS and unicast services is up to UE implementation. In this release of the 
specification, an MBMS capable UE is only required to support reception of a single MBMS service at a time, and 
reception of more than one MBMS service (also possibly on more than one MBSFN area) in parallel is left for UE 
implementation. The MCCH carries the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message, which indicates the MBMS sessions that 
are ongoing as well as the (corresponding) radio resource configuration. The MCCH may also carry the 
MBMSCountingRequest message, when E-UTRAN wishes to count the number of UEs in RRC_CONNECTED that are 
receiving or interested to receive one or more specific MBMS services. 

A limited amount of MBMS control information is provided on the BCCH. This primarily concerns the information 
needed to acquire the MCCH(s). This information is carried by means of a single MBMS specific 
SystemInformationBlock : SystemInformationBlockType13. An MBSFN area is identified solely by the mbsfn-AreaId in 
SystemInformationBlockType13. At mobility, the UE considers that the MBSFN area is continuous when the source cell 
and the target cell broadcast the same value in the mbsfn-AreaId. 

5.8.1.2             Scheduling 

The MCCH information is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period. Scheduling information is 
not provided for MCCH i.e. both the time domain scheduling as well as the lower layer configuration are semi-statically 
configured, as defined within SystemInformationBlockType13. 

For MBMS user data, which is carried by the MTCH logical channel, E-UTRAN periodically provides MCH 
scheduling information (MSI) at lower layers (MAC). This MCH information only concerns the time domain 
scheduling i.e. the frequency domain scheduling and the lower layer configuration are semi-statically configured. The 
periodicity of the MSI is configurable and defined by the MCH scheduling period. 

5.8.1.3             MCCH information validity and notification of changes 

Change of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. 
Within a modification period, the same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its 
scheduling (which is based on a repetition period). The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for 

                                                             ETSI 

----------------------- Page 105-----------------------

3GPP TS 36.331 version 10.6.0 Release 10                     104                        ETSI TS 136 331 V10.6.0 (2012-07) 

which SFN mod m= 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification 
period is configured by means of SystemInformationBlockType13. 

When the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change during a first 
modification period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated MCCH information. These 
general principles are illustrated in figure 5.8.1.3-1, in which different colours indicate different MCCH information. 
Upon receiving a change notification, a UE interested to receive MBMS services acquires the new MCCH information 
immediately from the start of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH information 
until the UE acquires the new MCCH information. 

                          Change notification                                     Updated information

            period 

                                  Figure 5.8.1.3-1: Change of MCCH Information 

Indication of an MBMS specific RNTI, the M-RNTI (see TS 36.321 [6]), on PDCCH is used to inform UEs in 
RRC_IDLE and UEs in RRC_CONNECTED about an MCCH information change. When receiving an MCCH 
information change notification, the UE knows that the MCCH information will change at the next modification period 
boundary. The notification on PDCCH indicates which of the MCCHs will change, which is done by means of an 8-bit 
bitmap. Within this bitmap, the bit at the position indicated by the field notificationIndicator is used to indicate changes 
for that MBSFN area: if the bit is set to "1", the corresponding MCCH will change. No further details are provided e.g. 
regarding which MCCH information will change. The MCCH information change notification is used to inform the UE 
about a change of MCCH information upon session start or about the start of MBMS counting. 

The MCCH information change notifications on PDCCH are transmitted periodically and are carried on MBSFN 
subframes only. These MCCH information change notification occasions are common for all MCCHs that are 
configured, and configurable by parameters included in SystemInformationBlockType13: a repetition coefficient, a radio 
frame offset and a subframe index. These common notification occasions are based on the MCCH with the shortest 
modification period. 

    NOTE 1:     E-UTRAN may modify the MBMS configuration information provided on MCCH at the same time as 
               updating the MBMS configuration information carried on BCCH i.e. at a coinciding BCCH and MCCH 
               modification period. Upon detecting that a new MCCH is configured on BCCH, a UE interested to 
               receive one or more MBMS services should acquire the MCCH, unless it knows that the services it is 
               interested in are not provided by the corresponding MBSFN area. 

A UE that is receiving an MBMS service shall acquire the MCCH information from the start of each modification 
period. A UE that is not receiving an MBMS service, as well as UEs that are receiving an MBMS service but potentially 
interested to receive other services not started yet in another MBSFN area, shall verify that the stored MCCH 
information remains valid by attempting to find the MCCH information change notification at least 
notificationRepetitionCoeff times during the modification period of the applicable MCCH(s), if no MCCH information 
change notification is received. 

    NOTE 2:     In case the UE is aware which MCCH(s) E-UTRAN uses for the service(s) it is interested to receive, the 
               UE may only need to monitor change notifications for a subset of the MCCHs that are configured, 
               referred to as the 'applicable MCCH(s)' in the above.

5.8.2           MCCH information acquisition 

5.8.2.1            General 

                               UE                                                      E-UTRAN

                                  Figure 5.8.2.1-1: MCCH information acquisition 

The UE applies the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MBMS control information that is 
broadcasted by the E-UTRAN. The procedure applies to MBMS capable UEs that are in RRC_IDLE or in 
RRC_CONNECTED. 

5.8.2.2            Initiation 

A UE interested to receive MBMS services shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon entering the 
corresponding MBSFN area (e.g. upon power on, following UE mobility) and upon receiving a notification that the 
MCCH information has changed. A UE that is receiving an MBMS service shall apply the MCCH information 
acquisition procedure to acquire the MCCH, that corresponds with the service that is being received, at the start of each 
modification period. 

Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the MCCH information acquisition procedure 
overwrites any stored MCCH information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for MCCH information and the UE 
discontinues using a field if it is absent in MCCH information unless explicitly specified otherwise. 

5.8.2.3            MCCH information acquisition by the UE 

An MBMS capable UE shall: 

    1> if the procedure is triggered by an MCCH information change notification: 

       2> start acquiring the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message and the MBMSCountingRequest message if present, 
           from the beginning of the modification period following the one in which the change notification was 
           received; 

    NOTE 1:     The UE continues using the previously received MCCH information until the new MCCH information 
               has been acquired. 

    1> if the UE enters an MBSFN area: 

       2> acquire the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message and the MBMSCountingRequest message if present, at the 
           next repetition period; 

    1> if the UE is receiving an MBMS service: 

       2> start acquiring the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message and the MBMSCountingRequest message if present, 
           that both concern the MBSFN area of the service that is being received, from the beginning of each 
           modification period; 

5.8.2.4            Actions upon reception of the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message 

No UE requirements related to the contents of this MBSFNAreaConfiguration apply other than those specified 
elsewhere e.g. within procedures using the concerned system information, the corresponding field descriptions.

5.8.2.5   Actions upon reception of the MBMSCountingRequest message 

Upon receiving MBMSCountingRequest message, the UE shall perform the MBMS Counting procedure as specified in 
section 5.8.4. 

5.8.3           MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration 

5.8.3.1             General 

The MBMS PTM radio bearer configuration procedure is used by the UE to configure RLC, MAC and the physical 
layer upon starting and/or stopping to receive an MRB. The procedure applies to UEs interested to receive one or more 
MBMS services. 

    NOTE:       In case the UE is unable to receive an MBMS service due to capability limitations, upper layers may take 
               appropriate action e.g. terminate a lower priority unicast service. 

5.8.3.2             Initiation 

The UE applies the MRB establishment procedure to start receiving a session of a service it has an interest in. The 
procedure may be initiated e.g. upon start of the MBMS session, upon (re-)entry of the corresponding MBSFN service 
area, upon becoming interested in the MBMS service, upon removal of UE capability limitations inhibiting reception of 
the concerned service. 

The UE applies the MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of 
the MBMS session, upon leaving the corresponding MBSFN service area, upon losing interest in the MBMS service, 
when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the concerned service. 

5.8.3.3             MRB establishment 

Upon MRB establishment, the UE shall: 

    1> establish an RLC entity in accordance with the configuration specified in 9.1.1.4; 

    1> configure an MTCH logical channel in accordance with the received locgicalChannelIdentity, applicable for the 
       MRB, as included in the MBSFNAreaConfiguration message; 

    1> configure the physical layer in accordance with thepmch-Config , applicable for the MRB, as included in the 
       MBSFNAreaConfiguration message; 

    1> inform upper layers about the establishment of the MRB by indicating the corresponding tmgi and sessionId ; 

5.8.3.4             MRB release 

Upon MRB release, the UE shall: 

    1> release the RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer configuration; 

    1> inform upper layers about the release of the MRB by indicating the corresponding tmgi and sessionId ;

                                   Figure 5.8.4.1-1: MBMS Counting procedure 

The MBMS Counting procedure is used by the E-UTRAN to count the number of RRC_CONNECTED mode UEs 
which are receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB the specified MBMS services. 

The UE determines interest in an MBMS service, that is identified by the TMGI, by interaction with upper layers. 

5.8.4.2   Initiation 

E-UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending an MBMSCountingRequest message. 

5.8.4.3   Reception of the MBMSCountingRequest message by the UE 

Upon receiving the MBMSCountingRequest message, the UE in RRC_CONNECTED mode shall: 

    1> if the SystemInformationBlockType1, that provided the scheduling information for the 
       systemInformationBlockType13 that included the configuration of the MCCH via which the 
       MBMSCountingRequest message was received, contained the identity of the Registered PLMN, and 

    1> if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB at least one of the services in the received 
       countingRequestList: 

       2> if more than one entry is included in the mbsfn-AreaInfoList received in the SystemInformationBlockType13 
           that included the configuration of the MCCH via which the MBMSCountingRequest message was received: 

           3> include the mbsfn-AreaIndex in the MBMSCountingResponse message and set it to the index of the entry 
              in the mbsfn-AreaInfoList within the received SystemInformationBlockType13 that corresponds with the 
              MBSFN area used to transfer the received MBMSCountingRequest message; 

       2> for each MBMS service included in the received countingRequestList: 

           3> if the UE is receiving via an MRB or interested to receive via an MRB this MBMS service: 

              4> include an entry in the countingResponseList within the MBMSCountingResponse message with 
                  countingResponseService set it to the index of the entry in the countingRequestList within the received 
                  MBMSCountingRequest that corresponds with the MBMS service the UE is receiving or interested to 
                  receive; 

       2> submit the MBMSCountingResponse message to lower layers for transmission upon which the procedure 
           ends; 

    NOTE 1:    UEs that are receiving an MBMS User Service [56] by means of a Unicast Bearer Service [57] (i.e. via a 
              DRB), but are interested to receive the concerned MBMS User Service [56] via an MBMS Bearer Service 
              (i.e. via an MRB), respond to the counting request. 

    NOTE 2:    If ciphering is used at upper layers, the UE does not respond to the counting request if it can not decipher 
              the MBMS service for which counting is performed (see TS 22.146 [62, 5.3]). 

    NOTE 3:    The UE treats the MBMSCountingRequest messages received in each modification period independently. 
              In the unlikely case E-UTRAN would repeat an MBMSCountingRequest (i.e. including the same services) 
              in a subsequent modification period, the UE responds again.

                & ASN.1) 

6.1              General 

The contents of each RRC message is specified in sub-clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to specify the message syntax and using 
tables when needed to provide further detailed information about the information elements specified in the message 
syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract types is further specified in a 
similar manner in sub-clause 6.3. 

The need for information elements to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are 
specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the 
OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction only. 
The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1-1. 

     Table 6.1-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for information elements to be 
                                                             present 

      Abbreviation                                                          Meaning 
Cond conditionTag              Conditionally present 
(Used in downlink only)        An information element for which the need is specified by means of conditions. For each 
                               conditionTag, the need is specified in a tabular form following the ASN.1 segment. In case, 
                               according to the conditions, a field is not present, the UE takes no action and where 
                               applicable shall continue to use the existing value (and/ or the associated functionality) 
                               unless explicitly stated otherwise in the description of the field itself. 
Need OP                         Optionally present 
(Used in downlink only)        An information element that is optional to signal. For downlink messages, the UE is not 
                               required to take any special action on absence of the IE beyond what is specified in the 
                               procedural text or the field description table following the ASN.1 segment. The UE behaviour 
                               on absence should be captured either in the procedural text or in the field description. 
Need ON                        Optionally present, No action 
(Used in downlink only)        An information element that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the UE, and 
                               in case the information element is absent, the UE takes no action and where applicable shall 
                               continue to use the existing value (and/ or the associated functionality). 
Need OR                         Optionally present, Release 
(Used in downlink only)        An information element that is optional to signal. If the message is received by the UE, and 
                               in case the information element is absent, the UE shall discontinue/ stop using/ delete any 
                               existing value (and/ or the associated functionality). 

Any IE with Need ON in system information shall be interpreted as Need OR. 

Need codes may not be specified for a group, used in downlink, which includes one or more extensions. Upon absence 
of such a field, the UE shall: 

    -    For each individual extension, including extensions that are mandatory to include in the optional group, act in 
        accordance with the need code that is defined for the extension; 

    -    Apply this behaviour not only for extensions included directly within the optional field, but also for extensions 
        defined at further nesting levels; 

    NOTE:        The above applies for groups of non critical extensions using double brackets, as well as non-critical 
                extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET 
                STRING. 

6.2              RRC messages 

    NOTE:        The messages included in this section reflect the current status of the discussions. Additional messages 
                may be included at a later stage.
